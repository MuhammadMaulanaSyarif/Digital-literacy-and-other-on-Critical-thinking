# Digital-literacy-and-other-on-Criticalthinking
In the era of independent learning, learning encourages students to independently master the learning material, therefore the role of teachers is indispensable to form learning independence. In addition to independence, critical thinking skills/higher order thanking skills (HOTS) are also treated in this day and age. Here I make a prediction on the Y variable, namely the ability to think critically about the impact generated on the X variable using validity test data at MA Mahir where the questionnaire will be used for research at MA Hidayatul Athfal.

**Goal**
1. To find out how much digital literacy affects critical thinking skills
2. To find out how much learning motivation affects critical thinking skills
3. To find out how much learning independence affects critical thinking skills
4. to find out how much the X variable affects the ability to think critically simultaneously

**Insight**
1. The model predicts the value with fairly good accuracy, with an average of small differences.
2. Some values (example line 2) show significant overestimation, but most predictions are pretty close to actual values.
3. The model can be used for further prediction, but optimization needs to be done to reduce errors in outliers such as rows 1 and 2.

**Advice**
1. Researchers may then need to create a more objective research questionnaire on related theories to better see and assess firsthand the development of related variables.
2. There is a need to develop the latest theory of related variables based on social factors that are certainly not always appropriate when tested
